is a 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code that

- allows to simulate intensity and polarization of light emerging from analytical astrophysical models as well as complex magneto-hydrodynamic simulations on various grids

- is capable to perform dust heating, -emission, -scattering, -grain alignment, line radiative transfer, and synchrotron simulations

- calculates synthetic intensity and polarization maps

- makes use of a full set of physical quantities (density, temperature, velocity, magnetic field distribution, and dust grain properties as well as different sources of radiation) as input

This branch extends POLARIS and adds the ability to calculate the reflected stellar radiation including polarization of planets arising from scattering in the atmosphere, surface or the planetary environment (e.g. circumplanetary rings).

## Requirements

The following packages are required for the installation:

- gcc (preferred), icc, or clang++

- cmake (preferred), or ninja

- Python version >= 3.6 (packages: *numpy*, *setuptools*)


## Installation (Linux)

Open a terminal/console and move into the POLARIS directory:
```bash
cd /YOUR/POLARIS/PATH/
```

To install POLARIS, run the installation script:
```bash
./compile.sh -f
```
For the first installation, the option `-f` is required to install the [CCfits](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/CCfits/) and [cfitsio](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/) libraries.
Alternatively, these libraries can be installed with a package manager (root permissions are required):
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libccfits-dev libcfitsio-dev
```
If these packages are installed on the system, simply install POLARIS via
```bash
./compile.sh
```
For more information, type:
```bash
./compile.sh -h
```
POLARIS can now be executed from any newly opened terminal/console.
To use it in already open terminals/consoles, execute the following command to update the environmental paths:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

**HINT**: Please refer to the [manual](manual.pdf) for installation on **macOS**. An installer to use POLARIS with Windows is not available yet.


## Use POLARIS

For a guide how to run first simulations, please take a look in our [quickstart](QUICKSTART.md).

For more information about POLARIS and its capabilities, please take a look in our [manual](manual.pdf).

If you use results from POLARIS in a publication, please cite [Reissl et al. (2016)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...593A..87R) or [Reissl et al. (2018)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ascl.soft07001R).
