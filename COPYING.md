Any publication that makes use of the software package (completely or in part) must mention the name of the POLARIS code and cite the paper ([Reissl et al. 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...593A..87R)) and the [website](https://portia.astrophysik.uni-kiel.de/polaris).
A second paper dealing with line radiative transfer and the Zeeman effect must be cited in addition ([Brauer et al. 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...601A..90B)) if line radiative transfer and/or Zeeman simulations are used.
