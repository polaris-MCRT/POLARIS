# POLARIS Quickstart Guide

## Download

Download zip package from the [homepage](https://portia.astrophysik.uni-kiel.de/polaris) or clone the [github repository](https://github.com/polaris-MCRT/POLARIS) via:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/polaris-MCRT/POLARIS.git
```
**HINT**: It is recommended to clone the git repository into the home directory.
If downloaded from the homepage, extract the zip file into the home directory via:
```bash
unzip -q POLARIS-master-basic.zip -d ~/
```


## Requirements

The following packages are required for the installation:

- gcc (preferred), icc, or clang++

- cmake (preferred), or ninja

- python3 (packages: *numpy*, *setuptools*)


## Installation

Open a terminal/console and move into the POLARIS directory:
```bash
cd /YOUR/POLARIS/PATH/
```

Run the installation script:
```bash
./compile.sh -f
```
For the first installation, the option `-f` is required to install the cfitsio and CCfits libraries.
For more information, type:
```bash
./compile.sh -h
```
POLARIS can now be executed from any newly opened terminal/console.
However, to use it in already open terminals/consoles, execute the following command to update the environmental paths:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```


## Start a simulation

POLARIS simulations are performed by parsing a command file with the simulation parameters.
Exemplary `.cmd` command files for temperature, thermal emission, and scattered stellar emission simulations can be found in

- `projects/disk/example/temp/`,
- `projects/disk/example/dust/`, and
- `projects/disk/example/dust_mc/`, respectively.

The simulations use an exemplary (binary) grid file `grid.dat` of a circumstellar disk which can be found in `projects/disk/`.

To start the temperature simulation (`temp`), move into the POLARIS directory and execute `polaris` followed by the command file:
```bash
cd /YOUR/POLARIS/PATH/
polaris projects/disk/example/temp/POLARIS.cmd
```
The results are stored at `projects/disk/example/temp/data/` as `.fits.gz` files. These files can be opened with, for example, [SAOImageDS9](https://sites.google.com/cfa.harvard.edu/saoimageds9/home), or a python script using [astropy](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/generated/examples/io/plot_fits-image.html).

Simulations are performed similarly for thermal emission (`dust`) and stellar scattered radiation (`dust_mc`).
Please refer to the [command list](projects/CommandList.cmd) in the `projects` folder or the [manual](manual.pdf) for available options of the command file.

**HINT**: For thermal emission simulations, a temperature simulation has to be performed first.

**HINT**: The previous results will be overwritten, if the same command file is used. Please change `<path_out>` in the command file to use a new directory for the new results.

**HINT**: If users write their own command file, before starting the simulation, please check `<dust_component>`, `<path_grid>`, and `<path_out>` in the command file for the correct (absolute) paths.

## Create a grid

### Predefined models

The (binary) grid file can be created with the command `polaris-gen`.
There are already two models available:

**Circumstellar disk** with a [Shakura & Sunyaev](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1973A&A....24..337S) density distribution
([Lynden-Bell & Pringle 1974](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1974MNRAS.168..603L); [Hartmann et al. 1998](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998ApJ...495..385H))

$$
\rho(r, z) = \rho_0 \left( \frac{r}{r_0} \right)^{-\alpha} \times \exp\left[ -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{z}{h(r)} \right)^2 \right]
$$

$$
h(r) = h_0 \left( \frac{r}{r_0} \right)^\beta
$$

Default values: $r_0 = 100\,\mathrm{AU}$, $h_0 = 10\,\mathrm{AU}$, $\alpha = 0.9$, $\beta = 1.1$, inner disk radius $r_\mathrm{in} = 0.1\,\mathrm{AU}$, outer disk radius $r_\mathrm{out} = 100\,\mathrm{AU}$, and total gas mass $M_\mathrm{gas} = 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ with a dust to gas mass ratio of 0.01.

**Sphere** with a constant density distribution

$$
\rho(r) = \rho_0
$$

Default values: inner radius $r_\mathrm{in} = 0.1\,\mathrm{AU}$, outer radius $r_\mathrm{out} = 100\,\mathrm{AU}$, and total gas mass $M_\mathrm{gas} = 10^{-4}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ with a dust to gas mass ratio of 0.01.

To create a grid file, use
```bash
polaris-gen model_name grid_filename.dat
```
where `model_name` is either `disk`, or `sphere`.
The (binary) grid file will be stored at `projects/model_name/`.
By default, the density distribution is normalized to the given total mass.
It is also possible to modify some parameters of the model.
For example, to create a grid with a total gas mass of $10^{-5}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and an inner radius of $1\,\mathrm{AU}$, type:
```bash
polaris-gen model_name grid_filename.dat --gas_mass 1e-5M_sun --inner_radius 1AU
```
For more information, type:
```bash
polaris-gen -h
```


### Extra parameter

To modify further model specific parameter values, the user can parse a list of parameter values using the option `--extra` followed by a list of values (int, float, or str).
By default, the user can parse

- 4 values for the `disk` model: reference radius $r_0$, reference scale height $h_0$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$,

- 1 value for the `sphere` model: the geometry of the magnetic field (toroidal, vertical, or radial).

Additional parameter values to modify the model can be defined in the function `update_parameter` in the file `tools/polaris_tools_modules/model.py`.

**Hint**: For any changes in the files, the user has to recompile with:
```bash
./compile.sh -u
```


### Custom model

For a more complex model modification, it is recommended that users define their own models in `tools/polaris_tools_custom/model.py`.
Therein, each model is defined as a class with a corresponding entry in the dictionary at the top of `model.py`.
Similar, to create a grid file for a custom model, use
```bash
polaris-gen model_name grid_filename.dat
```
where `model_name` is the name of the model in the dictionary of `model.py`.

**Hint**: For any changes in the files, the user has to recompile with:
```bash
./compile.sh -u
```


### Convert a grid file

Users can also write and edit their own grid file.
For this purpose, the command `polaris-gen` has an ascii to binary converter (and vice versa) for converting grid files.
To convert an existing ascii grid file to a binary grid file, use
```bash
polaris-gen model_name grid_filename.txt --convert ascii2binary
```
To convert an existing binary grid file to an ascii grid file, use
```bash
polaris-gen model_name grid_filename.dat --convert binary2ascii
```
The input grid file has to be located in `projects/model_name/` and the new output grid file will be stored at `projects/model_name/`.
For the general structure and available options in the grid file, please read the [manual](manual.pdf).
